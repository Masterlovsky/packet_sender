# Usage
`python zipf_packets.py -f <number of flows> -p <number of packets> -s <size of packet in bytes> -e <exponent greater than 1>`

`python http_zipf_packets.py -i <ip> -f <number of flows> -p <number of packets> -s <size of packet in bytes> -e <exponent greater than 1>`

Note: A tail heavy distribution correlates with the increase of the exponent.
